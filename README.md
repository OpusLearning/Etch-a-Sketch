How to Use
1. Grid Size
    â€¢ Adjust the Grid Size: Use the grid size slider to set the dimensions of your grid. The grid is square, so moving the slider to 64 means you'll have a 64x64 grid, totalling 4,096 squares of colour fun!
2. Random Colours
    â€¢ Generate Random Colours: Click the "Random Colours" button to fill the grid with a dazzling array of random colours. Each square will change its colour when you hover over it, thanks to the magical getRandomColor() function.
3. Custom Colours
    â€¢ Pick a Custom Colour: Select a colour using the colour picker. The grid will update to reflect your chosen colour, and every square will take on that hue as you hover over it.
    â€¢ See Your Selected Colours: Every time you pick a new colour, a dot appears under the grid, showing off your choices in all their glory.
4. Clear the Grid
    â€¢ Start Fresh: If you want a clean slate, simply hit the "Clear Grid" button. This will remove all the squares from the grid and clear out your selected colours.
Features
Dynamic Colour Generation
    â€¢ The getRandomColor() function is the star of the show here. It generates random hex colour codes by combining six random characters from the string "0123456789ABCDEF". The result? A grid full of unique and vibrant colours every time!
Customisable Grid
    â€¢ You can adjust the size of the grid to fit your needs. Want something small and simple? Set it to a smaller number. Feeling ambitious? Crank it up and enjoy the visual feast of a larger grid.
Interactive and Fun
    â€¢ Every square in the grid is interactive. Hover over a square to see it change to a random colour or your selected colour, making every movement a splash of creativity.
Technical Details
    â€¢ JavaScript: This tool uses vanilla JavaScript to handle DOM manipulation, event listeners, and dynamic content updates.
    â€¢ HTML/CSS: The grid is styled using CSS, with flexbox for layout and grid for the dynamic grid structure.
    â€¢ Colour Handling: The getRandomColor() function and the colour picker allow for both random and custom colour generation, giving users full control over their grid's appearance.
